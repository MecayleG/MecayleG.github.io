        <div class="tab">
            I am a software developer based in Cape Town who has experience in administration and customer service but would like to broaden my knowledge in terms of technology and programming. I spend most of my free time bettering myself as an individual and trying
            things I haven’t done before. I enjoy doing front-end development but I would really like to continue learning the full stack of web development in more context and learn more languages. A quote that I live by and that has helped me alot as
            an individual who always seems to be getting ahead of herself.
            <br>
            <q>Start by doing what's necessary, then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the
               impossible. <br>

                    goods and where they can be dropped off. Since it was my idea I decided to redo the app.<a href="https://upcyc1e.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Check it out here</a>
